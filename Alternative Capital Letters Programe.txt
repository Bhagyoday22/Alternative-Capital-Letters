    ' Take the inputbox to enter the name or to take the name from user
    
    Name = InputBox("Enter Your Name", "Name Window")

    ' To find the length of the name declare the variable & store the length in that variable
 
    Name_length = Len(Name)

    ' Use the for loop to find the alternative letters from given data or name which is type by the user
    
    For i = 1 To Name_length Step 2

      ' To display the letters in capital letters from the given data or name use the ucase function
      
      a = UCase(Mid(Name, i, 1))
      
      ' To display or to show  the alternative letters in capitals use message box

      MsgBox a

      ' To display the letters in small letters from the given data or name use the lcase function
      
      b = LCase(Left(Mid(Name, i + 1, i), 2 - 1))

      ' To display or to show  the alternative letters in small use message box
      MsgBox b
